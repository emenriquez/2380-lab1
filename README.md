# Lab 1 Codespaces Test: C++
1. Complete the exercises in lab1.cpp (function definitions - no main() function should be written).


### Setup command
N/A

### Run command
`make test`

### Notes
- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- If students push `a.out` files, the autograder may attempt to run that version instead of a newly compiled binary. If this happens, and your student isn't on Linux, the script will crash. To fix this issue, it's recommended to clean before building.
